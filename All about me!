- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jhitchmough3
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and developing programs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of python in school but i am focusing on gces at the minute so we haven't had much time to do any coding. I try in my free time though and thats why im on git hub!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects or any sort of opportunities in the computing area.
- 📫 How to reach me you can add my snapchat at @jhitchmough3 --- Instagram @jack_hitchmough --- Discord Tacos#6758.
 If anyone is interested in helping me on my journey on how to code it would be highly appreciated and i would love your help.
 
 Thanks for reading, :).
